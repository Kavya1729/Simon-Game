# Simon Game

The Simon Game is a memory game where the player has to repeat a sequence of colors and sounds that the game plays. The sequence gets longer as the game progresses. This version of the Simon game is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** only, without the use of any external libraries.

## **Game Features**

- **Color Sequence**: The game generates a random sequence of colored buttons.
- **User Interaction**: The user must click the buttons in the same order as the generated sequence.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: With each round, the sequence gets longer, making it more challenging.
- **Sound Feedback**: Each color button plays a sound when clicked or when it is part of the sequence.
- **Game Over**: If the user clicks the wrong button or fails to match the sequence, the game ends.
